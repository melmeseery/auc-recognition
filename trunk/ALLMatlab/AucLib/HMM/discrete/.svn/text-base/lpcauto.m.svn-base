%  <Synopsis>
%    [ar,xi,e,m] = lpcauto(x,M,win,Olap)
%
%  <Description>
%    The function performs autocorrelation based LP analysis on the
%    signal vector x in overlapping, windowed frames. The frame length
%    is determined by the length of the window function vector win, and
%    the overlap is given by Olap. In each frame, the function finds the
%    coefficients, ar=[1 -a(1) ... -a(M)], of an M'th order forward linear
%    predictor
% 
%      xhat(n) = a(1)*x(n-1) + a(2)*x(n-2) + ... + a(M)*x(n-M)
%
%    such that the sum of the squares of the prediction errors
%
%      ehat(n) = x(n) - xhat(n)
%
%    is minimized. The LP coefficients for each frame are returned in the
%    columns of the matrix ar, and the prediction error energies for the
%    0'th to the M'th order solution are returned in the columns of the
%    matrix xi.
%
%    The residual signal e is obtained by applying the inverse filters
%    A(z) to the speech frames (rectangular window). In overlapping
%    regions the residual signals will be interpolated according to the
%    window function used to find the LP coefficients. The vector m gives
%    the index of the last sample in each frame.
