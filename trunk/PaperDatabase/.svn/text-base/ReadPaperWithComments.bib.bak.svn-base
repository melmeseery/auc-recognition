	This paper presents the results of handwritten digit recognition on
	well-known image databases using state-of-the-art feature extraction
	and classification techniques. The tested databases are CENPARMI,
	CEDAR, and MNIST. On the test data set of each database, 80 recognition
	accuracies are given by combining eight classifiers with ten feature
	vectors. The features include chaincode feature, gradient feature,
	profile structure feature, and peripheral direction contributivity.
	The gradient feature is extracted from either binary image or gray-scale
	image. The classifiers include the k-nearest neighbor classifier,
	three neural classifiers, a learning vector quantization classifier,
	a discriminative learning quadratic discriminant function (DLQDF)
	classifier, and two support vector classifers (SVCs). All the classifers
	and feature vectors give high recognition accuracies. Relatively,
	the chaincode feature and the gradient feature show advantage over
	other features, and the profle structure feature shows eficiency
	as a complementary feature. The SVC with RBF kernel (SVC-rbf) gives
	the highest accuracy in most cases but is extremely expensive in
	storage and computation. Among the non-SV classifiers, the polynomial
	classifier and DLQDF give the highest accuracies. The results of
	non-SV classifiers are competitive to the best ones previously reported
	on the same databases.},
